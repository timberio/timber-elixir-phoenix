The Timber Phoenix library provides enhanced logging for your Phoenix-based application.

## Installation

Ensure that you have both `:timber` (version 3.0.0 or later) and `:timber_phoenix` listed
as dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:timber, "~> 3.0"},
    {:timber_phoenix, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get`.

You'll need to add a configuration line for every Phoenix endpoint. For example,
if you have the application `:my_app` and the Phoenix endpoint `MyApp.Endpoint`,
the configuration in `config/config.exs` would look like this:

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Endpoint,
  # ...,
  instrumenters: [Timber.Phoenix],
```

For more information, see the documentation for the
[Timber.Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/timber-phoenix/Timber.Phoenix.html) module.

### Notes for Umbrella Applications

When integrating Timber with Phoenix for an umbrella application, the
`:timber_phoenix` library needs to be a dependency for every application that
defines an Phoenix endpoint.
